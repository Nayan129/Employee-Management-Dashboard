# Employee Management App (React + Context API)

A role-based Employee Management Dashboard built with **React**, **Context API**, and **Tailwind CSS**.  
Admin can assign tasks to employees, and employees can manage tasks by accepting, completing, or failing them.  
All updates reflect instantly across the UI and persist using **LocalStorage**.
